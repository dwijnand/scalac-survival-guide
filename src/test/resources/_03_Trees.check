=========================== More ways to create trees ===========================


// We can also parse source code into a tree
hello parser
hello quasiquote
// This is called quasiquoting. Composing trees by splicing them into quasiquotes
println({
  println("hello quasiquote");
  println("hello quasiquote");
  "okay"
})

// Wait, what was that q doing?
// We'll dive into that one shortly!
// The structure of trees can be explored with a few combinators, like in the collections:
// foreach 
// collect 
List(println)

scala.Predef.println("hello parser") does call println

// For more control over the recursion, use a Traverser
// ... and, to generate a new tree, use a Transformer
